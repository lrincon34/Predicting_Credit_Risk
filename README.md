# Predicting_Credit_Risk

Based on the results, I would recommend using the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier as it has a Precision score (Positive Predictive Value) of 99% and a Recall (Sensitivity) score of 90%. Compared to the other models, this model superseded the others by at least 32%. The model with the lowest Recall score was the Random Under Sampler at 53%. Based on the modules information, Precision scores measure how reliable a positive classification is while the Recall/Sensitivity score measures a model's performance. **Since, Sensitivity is more important than Precision, i would choose the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.**
